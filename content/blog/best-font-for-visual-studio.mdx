Unlike the default user, most programmers do care about the font they are using, so do I.

## Currently Using

### JetBrains Mono

Try JetBrains Mono in your IDE. Its simple forms and attention to every detail make coding a nice experience for developers’ eyes, no matter which IDE you choose.
Checkout the official website. The website itself is **MARVELLOUS**.

#### VS Code Settings

```json
"editor.fontFamily": "JetBrains Mono, Fira Code",
"editor.fontSize": 13,
"editor.fontLigatures": true,
"editor.letterSpacing": 1.2,
```

### Fira Code

Monospaced font with programming ligatures.

All the instructions to install the font and configuring it in the IDE's including **Visual Studio** and **Visual Studio Code** is documented in the wiki.

## Previously Used

### Fantasque Sans Mono

Fantasque Sans Mono is my choice for the past two years. You need to try it to see how good it is.

> A programming font, designed with functionality in mind, and with some wibbly-wobbly handwriting-like fuzziness that makes it unassumingly cool.

:point_right: GitHub: [belluzj/fantasque-sans](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans) (3k+ stars).

> A font family with a great monospaced variant for programmers.

#### How to install new font (windows)

- Download the font from [here](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans/releases/latest)
- In the ttf folder, double-click each font file, click “Install font”; to install all at once, select all files, right-click, and choose “Install”.
- Open Visual Studio settings. **Tools > Options > Environment > Fonts and Colors** > Choose **Fantasque Sans Mono** from the font
  list > OK.

If you have a better suggestion, let me know in the comments.
