  Here I am listing the labels which I used to organize my tasks in almost all the project management solutions like Jira, Gitlab and GitHub.
tags:
  - project-management
  - github
  - gitlab
  - jira
  - style-guide

Labels are a good way to categorize the tasks. But having too many in an unorganized way results more clutter.
Here is my way of labeling issues/tasks. This is the way I organize my tasks in **GitHub**, **GitLab** and in **Jira**.

### Area

Indicating the area to which issues belong.

| Label              | Description       | Color |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ----- |
| area:optimization  | Fine tuning works |       |
| area:documentation |                   |       |
| area:security      |                   |       |

### Priority

Used to prioritize the issues.

| Label                                                        | Description                          | Color     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | --------- |
| <Badge fill="#d93f0b" textColorIsWhite>priority:high</Badge> | Requires immediate attention         | `#d93f0b` |
| priority:medium                                              | Requires attention soon              |           |
| priority:low                                                 | Does not require immediate attention |           |

### Stage

Indicating the current stage of the issue.

| Label                                                                 | Description                                                         | Color     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| stage:investigating                                                   | Someone is looking into this                                        |           |
| stage:wontfix                                                         | Does not regard this as an issue or will not implement this feature |           |
| stage:backlog                                                         | Prioritized to be picked up in current sprint                       |           |
| stage:proposal                                                        | No work has been done of this issue                                 |           |
| stage:awaiting response                                               | Potential fix was proposed; awaiting response                       |           |
| stage:pending release                                                 | Works associated with this issue is done but not deployed           |           |
| stage:ready for work                                                  | The issue is reproducible and in scope                              |           |
| stage:needs information                                               | Not enough info to reproduce the issue                              |           |
| stage:needs review                                                    | Work done but needs review                                          |           |
| stage:needs investigating                                             | Someone needs to look at this                                       |           |
| <Badge fill="#68db1c" textColorIsWhite>stage:work in progress</Badge> | Someone is working on it                                            | `#68db1c` |
| stage:test                                                            | Deployed to TEST environment                                        |           |

**Stage** labels like _in progress, backlog_ etc can be skipped in **GitHub** if you linked the issue to a project which has relevant columns matching these stages.

### Type
