I'm Edson Frainlar Inghyasi, a [Product Engineer](https://github.com/Frainlar) working at [KTern](https://ktern.com) from January 2018. At the moment my desk is located in **Chennai, India**, the leading SaaS Hub of the World. 

Landed to Earth on 1 October 1995 at [Kalayarkovil, Sivagangai - Tamil Nadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalayar_Kovil). Completed my Primary schooling at **Kalashetra School, Poonamallee**. Pursued my Secondary and Higher Secondary Education at [St. Joseph's Matriculation Higher Secondary School, Poonamallee](http://sjmhsschool.ac.in/).

Decided by choice and fate, I did my Undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [DMI College of Engineering](https://www.dmice.ac.in) under full-fee waiver scholarship offered by the [DMI Foundations Trust](http://www.dmiindia.org).

Got recruited to [Kaar Technologies](https://www.kaartech.com) on 19th June, 2016. Started as an Intern at Kaar Technologies on 23rd June, 2017.

I feel fortunate to be the member of the first team of KTern - A Digital Transformation Suite from the house of Kaar Technologies. My role involves prototyping, developing backend as well as front-end with the modern workflows and frameworks keeping an eye on the patterns and organized code.

Exploring and working in Microservices, Domain driven Development and DevSecOps right now. Mostly affined towards JavaScript framework. Trying to get out with new relationship with Python and Rust. Aspired to do a research on Quantum Information and Computing in future. **Looking for the learning partner in my Research journey.**

In Socio-cultural research path, I'm exploring the rich ecological, cultural, linguistic, ethnical heritage and the current political situations of two silos of India - Ladakh and Andaman Islands (Not Nicobar right now). Manages two Facebook pages and publish my studies regularly there with 3K Followers mostly from Leh and Port Blair. 

I blog about Programming, Computer Science and Information Technology, Socio-cultural Regions of India, Quantum Technologies, Book reviews and sometimes politically. Ideologically, I'm a left guy affined to the thoughts of Thanthai Periyar, Karl Marx, Che Guevara, Jawaharalal Nehru and Dr. Ambedkar.
