I'm Abhith Rajan, a [Software Engineer](https://github.com/abhith) from India. I work for the Product Team at [Emcredit](https://www.emcredit.com/). At the moment my desk is located in **DIFC Dubai**, the leading financial centre in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia region.

My role involves prototyping, developing backend as well as front end apps with the modern workflows, frameworks. Keeping an eye on the patterns and organized code. Same time deploy them using Azure DevOps pipelines and monitor everything running in Azure. For the backend apps including microservices am a .NET guy. For the front-end apps, we have so many choices, and my decision engine given below,

- For full fledged portal or a custom CMS, go with **Angular**.
- For micro apps, **Nuxt.js** (Which built on top of Vue).
- For javascript SDK's, **React**.
- For documentation, **Docusaurus** (which built on top of React).

I blog about programming, code, technology and stuffs that I'm interested in.

## BACKGROUND

I started my career at [Aabasoft](http://aabasoft.com) where I joined as an intern after my B-Tech education and worked there for over 3 years as a Software Engineer and then moved to [Sysberries](http://sysberries.com) where I spend another almost 3 years, then in [Unibeton Ready Mix](http://www.unibetonrm.com/en-gl/home). In 2019, I joined [Emcredit](https://www.emcredit.com/) where I work now.

## INFORMATION OVERFLOW

I love racing, big fan of **Valentino Rossi**. The first thing I bought after I got my first job was my **Yamaha R15 V2** bike. And I got a cool number for that bike, KL 40J **201**. After I moved to UAE, the one thing that hurt me most is, **I MISS MY BIKE**.
